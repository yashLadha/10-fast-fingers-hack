# Hack for 10 Fast Fingers
This is a script which opens a browser session of 10fastfingers and implements the `GOD typing Hack`

If you to use it on your account, change the code at line 6 as
```py
profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile('/home/{your_username}/.mozilla/firefox/{your_default_profile}')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(profile)
```

If you just want to test this script, just run it as it is, and there is no change in code.
